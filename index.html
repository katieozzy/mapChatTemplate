        <h1>A World(view) Transformed by War</h1>
        <div>
          Qing China’s defeat by Britain in the two mid-19th century Opium Wars (1840-42, 1856-60) were significant 
          moments in modern Chinese history. Their failure to suppress the British-led opium trade heralded a century 
          of humiliation plagued by unequal treaties and forced concessions of territorial and sovereignty rights to 
          foreign imperialist powers. In a country ravaged by foreign invasions, the Qing had no choice but to revise 
          their understanding of the world order while mapmakers revised their maps accordingly. <br><br>
          A comparison of two maps within the Maclean Collection help illustrate these revisions.

              Both maps were discussed in an earlier map chat by the curator of the collection. This present map chat dives deeper into a previously untouched area of comparison – each mapmaker’s geopolitical vision.
            In Zhuang Tingfu’s map, only the coordinates of major cities within the Qing were listed in his preface and subsequently circled out within the map. Meanwhile, foreign capitals and cities elsewhere were not shown. Toponyms of foreign places were written out over their general areas as no territorial borders between nation-states were drawn up. 
            In other words, Zhuang Tingu was chiefly interested in how the European geographic coordinate system and use of graticules could locate Qing China and its domain within the wider world.
            Conversely, the 1858 mapmaker showed more interest in the world beyond Qing China. Within his preface, he only listed out the coordinates of the major cities in Saiwai 塞外 (beyond the Great wall) and Xinjiang新疆 (new territories). Yet, cities all over the world were circled. 
            All provincial and country names including China’s 中華囯 were written in either red or black characters within the confines of their territorial borders. Political boundaries between nation-states and continents were drawn using dotted black lines overlaid with bolded red ones. 
            Such a line is seen stretching across both hemispheres to separate Oceania 啊撒尼洲 from Asia 亚细亚 and the Americas 亞墨利加洲. This suggests the use of updated sources since the name Oceania had only been coined roughly two decades prior to the Wanguo yutu by French explorer Dumont d’Urville in the early 1830s.

            What sparked this added interest in foreign territories had to be the two mid-19th century Opium Wars. Being produced in the midst of the second opium war, geopolitical matters and the Qing’s defeat were likely at the forefront of the mapmaker’s mind. 
            This revised worldview brought the 1858 mapmaker into the ranks of the earliest Qing reformers like the scholar-official Wei Yuan 魏源 (1794-1857). Qing China’s defeat in the first opium war prompted Wei to publish his famed geographical atlas, the Haiguo tuzhi 海國圖志, in three editions between 1844-52. 
            Being published for the masses,  this book popularised the image of a world of distinct competing nations, with China being just one of them. Each nation had a unique pattern of evolution in its habits, societies, and technologies. Within this world, states are expected to uphold the principle of Westphalian or national sovereignty, whereby each state holds exclusive sovereignty over its territory. The Haiguo tuzhi was the first indigenous Chinese work to assert that China had to participate in such a system. 
            This spelt a far cry from the Sino-centric tributary system which had framed the Middle Kingdom’s foreign relations since ancient times. Under the tributary system, foreign cultures gravitated towards the Chinese civilisation while foreign envoys voluntarily presented tribute to the emperor as an act of subordination. Like Wei Yuan, our 1858 mapmaker was highly conscious of this shift from a world oriented around the hierarchical relationship between suzerain and vassal to one oriented around the balance of power between states.

      <div>
        Zhuang Tingfu’s map had inspired many other 19th century maps in Qing China and Joseon Korea.  Yet, it was the 1858 Wanguo yutu that updated it most drastically to reflect the new Westphalian world order. Following the Qing’s defeat in the Opium Wars, interest in international law and Western geopolitical understandings steadily grew amongst the literati although it took a few more decades before China’s international outlook became fundamentally transformed.
