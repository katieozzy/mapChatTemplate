        <h1>A World(view) Transformed by War</h1>
        <div>
          Qing China’s defeat by Britain in the two mid-19th century Opium Wars (1840-42, 1856-60) were significant 
          moments in modern Chinese history. Their failure to suppress the British-led opium trade heralded a century 
          of humiliation plagued by unequal treaties and forced concessions of territorial and sovereignty rights to 
          foreign imperialist powers. In a country ravaged by foreign invasions, the Qing had no choice but to revise 
          their understanding of the world order while mapmakers revised their maps accordingly. <br><br>
          A comparison of two maps within the Maclean Collection help illustrate these revisions.

It is based on Zhuang’s 1800 map, visibly reproducing many elements like the inscriptions in the outer circles and the pair of straight ecliptic lines cutting diagonally across the hemispheres.</p>

          Both maps were discussed in an earlier map chat by the curator of the collection. This present map chat dives deeper into a previously untouched area of comparison – each mapmaker’s geopolitical vision.
          (Option A) As you drag the slider across, notice how much more detail the 1858 map gives about foreign nation-states as opposed to the 1800 one.
          (Option B) The 1858 map gives much more detail about foreign nation-states as opposed to the 1800 one.
          In Zhuang Tingfu’s map, only the coordinates of major cities within the Qing were listed in his preface and subsequently circled out within the map. Meanwhile, foreign capitals and cities elsewhere were not shown. Toponyms of foreign places were written out over their general areas as no territorial borders between nation-states were drawn up. 
          In other words, Zhuang Tingu was chiefly interested in how the European geographic coordinate system and use of graticules could locate Qing China and its domain within the wider world.
          Conversely, the 1858 mapmaker showed more interest in the world beyond Qing China. Within his preface, he only listed out the coordinates of the major cities in Saiwai 塞外 (beyond the Great wall) and Xinjiang新疆 (new territories). Yet, cities all over the world were circled. 
          All provincial and country names including China’s 中華囯 were written in either red or black characters within the confines of their territorial borders. Political boundaries between nation-states and continents were drawn using dotted black lines overlaid with bolded red ones. 
          Such a line is seen stretching across both hemispheres to separate Oceania 啊撒尼洲 from Asia 亚细亚 and the Americas 亞墨利加洲. This suggests the use of updated sources since the name Oceania had only been coined roughly two decades prior to the Wanguo yutu by French explorer Dumont d’Urville in the early 1830s.
